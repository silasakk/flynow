                        How many times do you imagine the average entrepreneur changes or alters his or her business

                        In the beginning of 2015 I developed neEvent which is short for New England event. My plan from the
                        was to deliver online nightclub, restaurant, lounge, sport, music, family and adult entertainment 
                        event information and services. I wanted to give the users the ability to get on v.i.p. guest lists for particip
                        ating events. This was the main focus of my winning strategy which I believed would bring the users and 
                        <br><br>
                        eventually make some money. After months of planning, development and testing I launched the site in 
                        February. I set up newsletters, event alerts and other campaigns to collect email addresses and contact in
                        formation.
                        <br><br>
                        By May things were going better then expected for the short period of time on the web with minimal capi
                        tal for advertising or marketing and very little search engine exposure.
                        <br><br>
                        How else can I make my internet destination sticky, I needed to give the users a reason to come back to 
                        the site other then to browse events and get on guest lists.
